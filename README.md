You are trying to organize an event for k attendees from among a potential set of n attendees. The problem is that there are some potential attendees that are absolutely inseparable; they refuse to go without each other. After extensive discussions with all potential attendees, you have drawn up a list of pairs (x[], y[]), such that x[i] 6= y[i] for all i, and x[i] will go to the event if and only if y[i] will go to the event. You need to figure out, given the constraints above, if it is possible to organize the event for exactly k attendees.
